Perceptual factors can have a big impact on how we see data in charts.
Cleveland's & McGill's famous experiments, for example, tell us that positional
stimuli convey ratios of quantities more accurately that color or area.
We build on this work by looking at comparative displays, in which more than one
data series are charted together to look for similarities, differences, or
trends.

We used Mechanical Turk to quickly conduct experiments with hundreds of
participants, with data and graphics generated in the browser in real time
using Javascript and D3. The experiments produced a variety of interesting
results, but the big surprises were (1) symmetrically arranged charts, such as
population pyramids can have meaningful perceptual benefits and (2) animation,
which is appealing but has had mixed empirical results in the past, can be
very effective for perceive subtle differences between two datasets.
